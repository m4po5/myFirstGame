# myFirstGame
_"first time using java, javafx and creating a game"_

### Source of inspiration
based on [this nifty tutorial](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/introduction-to-javafx-for-game-development--cms-23835)

### Disclaimer
I've been working for a little while with c# and WPF, but longed to induldge in java.
I also decided to try out creating games in javafx.
So after the [GettingStarted tutorials at oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/jfxpub-get_started.htm), I tried out the above mentioned.

In this project, I took the final example game from the tutorial, began refactoring
and will attempt to introduce my own ideas for mechanics, leaderboards, navigation and such.
